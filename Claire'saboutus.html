				About Us
			</h1>
			<p>

Claire's Flowers was established over 100 years ago and is still in the family! 
Our family business has lasted this long based on a very simple business practice: our brides and clients come first. 

You receive beautiful flowers at a reasonable cost. 

Not to mention, you are NOT just a number! With personal attention, we are able to tailor your flower needs to your location, your wants and your budget. 

We also offer personal services and coordinating at church and reception sites. 
If you are planning an event or a party, we can also provide your floral and rental needs for any function. 

Silk packages are also available. Once you have settled on your wedding or event, call for an appointment to sit down and discuss color and selections. 
Your one-on-one appointment will go over everything you need with respect to design, flower availability and the overall look you want. 
You will also receive an estimate for your budget. We’ve been to just about every church and venue in the city and can offer advice on the many needs of those sites. 
During your visit, you will see just some of our many weddings and parties…maybe you’ll see one of your friends in our books! 

Come to a wedding specialist to discuss all of your dreams.
