Everyone has a budget of some kind for every part of their wedding or
event. We strive to meet every client’s wants and budget. Some pricing
will vary depending on style, flower and time of the year. The following
is a wide range of prices that reflect weddings, receptions, events and
parties. <br /><br />Always call <strong>816-523-3323</strong> to set up
an appointment for a more accurate estimate and to discuss what other
services you may need. We can also act as your support staff at any venue.
<br /><br />FLORALS: Bridal Bouquets.... hand-tied is still very popular;
however, European cascades are making a comeback. There are still classic
looks of white and cream, but spring and summer brides are turning to
color. Purple and blue are trendy colors. There are plenty of spring and
summer flowers in those shades, including hydrangeas. Fall and winter
looks will feature rich shades of browns, greens, cranberries and fire
oranges. Ranges $80-275 Maids’ Bouquets…<strong> hand-tied </strong>is the
number one attendants’ floral, but with unique wrapping and accessories,
your maids can compliment your bouquet while not competing! Colors
especially, purples, blues, greens and oranges are this year’s great
looks. Ranges $40-70 For the Men…classic boutonnieres(roses and mini
callas) are still the favorites but now we are using simpler flowers such
as green hypercum berries and the sophisticated mini orchids. Some of our
weddings haven’t even had boutonnieres! Just a splash of color still looks
the best, but cream is really making a comeback. Ranges $3-15 For the
Women…corsages have broadened out to include the “pin on” and “wrist” but
now some mothers are opting for a hand-held mini bouquet or nothing at
all! Usually we match corsages with the wedding flowers or the color of
the dress. Ranges $12-20 <br /><br />CEREMONY/SITE FLOWERS: Some churches
are not allowing decorations; however, many sites just need a little
touch. Pews/Aisles…bows or tulle still is very popular, but many are
choosing to add a little touch of flowers, nothing much, just a touch. In
the spring and summer, fresh ivy is always in. At the alter many brides
choose to decorate candelabra and to place florals at the front (ones they
can also use at the reception). Don’t be afraid to use florals
twice…everyone is doing it! Ranges $5 (pew bows) $30 on up (florals on
candelabra or arrangements) Most brides are budgeting $100-300 for any
church or ceremony site decorations. <br /><br />RECEPTION/EVENT: Cake
Flowers…many brides are opting for a very simple cake and adding their own
design with flowers that match the wedding. Imagine, you love gerbera
daisies and they just don’t go with your dress…use them on the cake! We
always include the throw bouquet as the topper (unless you have something
else) and draw out the specific look you want. Make it fun or make it a
masterpiece…it’s your cake so enjoy. Ranges $30-150 Table
Arrangements…depending on your venue you may want all the pieces to match
or you may want to go with the popular trend of 3 to 4 different designs.
The look as you enter the venue is classic and dramatic. If want to go
with height we have several props for your design. If you are in need of
votives to give that intimate cocktail glow we can furnish hundreds.
Candlelight is definitely a trend that your budget can love! Ranges $1
(votive with candles)-35 (on the average) Obviously, there are many floral
ideas that can be done for $10 and others that run $75 and on up. We also
offer servicing from pinning on your corsages to setting up your party
favors. Each bride or client’s needs are specific so all pricing is done
on a one-to-one basis and when you have your appointment, you will leave
with your own designed floral estimate and the pricing as well. That is
the true trend of this year...<br /><br />CUSTOMER SERVICE! We've been
doing it for years.
